17:24:27  <stevenknight> hey all 
17:25:42  <garyo-home>   Hi, Steven. 
17:25:50  <garyo-home>   Hi, Greg (?) 
17:26:00  <garyo-home>   Anyone else here yet? 
17:26:15  <stevenknight> just got here myself 
17:26:23  <stevenknight> haven't seen anyone else 
17:26:39  <garyo-home>   Looks like the bug list should be pretty short this time. 
17:26:49  <stevenknight> yep 
17:37:21  <garyo-home>   Anyway... where's Greg? 
17:39:12  <stevenknight> well, Greg entered his comments, shall we dive in and do what we can? 
17:39:24  <garyo-home>   Yes, I was just thinking that. 
17:39:46  <garyo-home>   2279: how about I integrate it, and we give Arve commit rights on his next patch? 
17:40:13  <garyo-home>   Unless you have swig. 
17:40:09  <stevenknight> sounds good -- or actually, 
17:40:23  <stevenknight> i may have been thinking about someone different for commit rights 
17:40:35  <stevenknight> IIRC Greg's been talking with Ben Webb about becoming the SWIG guru 
17:40:49  <stevenknight> I do have swig installed so could do at least a sanity check on it 
17:41:02  <garyo-home>   Oh, right.  Maybe we should let Ben check it then. 
17:41:15  <stevenknight> okay, i'll follow up w/Greg and/or Ben 
17:41:28  <stevenknight> and integrate it myself if neither of them has cycles 
17:41:25  <garyo-home>   good. 
17:41:30  <stevenknight> done 
17:41:43  <garyo-home>   2281: I think you're right, error if no action. 
17:42:04  <stevenknight> okay, 2.0 p3... me? 
17:42:10  <stevenknight> since i spoke up... 
17:42:12  <garyo-home>   yes. 
17:42:33  <stevenknight> 2281:  2.0, p3, sk 
17:42:33  <stevenknight> done 
17:43:00  <stevenknight> 2282:  1.3, p3, who? 
17:43:12  <garyo-home>   right, who.  I can do it, or maybe Greg would. 
17:43:31  <garyo-home>   Heck, count me in, I've done a bunch of doc already. 
17:43:39  <stevenknight> okay 
17:43:43  <stevenknight> 2282:  1.3, p3, garyo 
17:43:44  <stevenknight> done 
17:43:45  <stevenknight> thanks 
17:44:04  <stevenknight> 2283: 
17:44:11  <garyo-home>   2283: we need to actually see the patch before we can do anything. 
17:44:15  <stevenknight> do you see any significant downside to going with it? 
17:44:23  <stevenknight> i looked and it seemed pretty reasonable to me 
17:44:38  <garyo-home>   Good -- no, as long as it doesn't break anything, why not. 
17:44:52  <stevenknight> i wasn't sure what Greg's concerns are w.r.t. "special-case cross-compiling" 
17:45:15  <garyo-home>   I think he wants to specify cross-compilation at a toolchain level in a nice way. 
17:45:34  <stevenknight> i see 
17:45:07  <stevenknight> 2.x p3 seem reasonable? 
17:45:13  <stevenknight> right now those don't need to be assigned 
17:45:29  <stevenknight> and we're going to have to have a big assignment party some time post 1.3 for those 
17:45:38  <garyo-home>   Yes, 2.x for all feature requests is good. 
17:45:42  <stevenknight> not just as an implementation within a specific tool, right 
17:45:47  <garyo-home>   right. 
17:45:48  <stevenknight> okay 
17:45:54  <stevenknight> 2283:  2.x, p3, TBD 
17:45:57  <stevenknight> done 
17:46:16  <stevenknight> 2284: 
17:46:22  <garyo-home>   as you say, it's a dup. 
17:46:24  <stevenknight> I'll DUP to 1914 
17:46:29  <garyo-home>   good! 
17:46:34  <stevenknight> cool, done with the current issues 
17:46:35  <garyo-home>   that was quick. 
17:46:39  <stevenknight> nice 
17:47:10  <garyo-home>   I spent some time on the 2005Q2 issues too. 
17:47:25  <stevenknight> excellent, let's see if we can get through those 
17:47:40  <garyo-home>   1140: close as WORKSFORME. 
17:47:48  <stevenknight> 1140:  done 
17:47:50  <garyo-home>   1185: consensus WORKSFORME. 
17:48:08  <stevenknight> 1185:  done 
17:48:21  <stevenknight> 1187:  research, sk 
17:48:25  <garyo-home>   yup. 
17:48:42  <stevenknight> 1188:  research, sk 
17:48:47  <stevenknight> close if confirm fix 
17:49:03  <garyo-home>   I actually tried 1188 and it worked.  ? 
17:49:11  <garyo-home>   But I had to make my own testcase. 
17:49:17  <stevenknight> do you still have it? 
17:49:46  <garyo-home>   Maybe.  It was just foo.c conditionally including foo.h, iirc. 
17:50:11  <stevenknight> with appropriate case change in the extension, i take it 
17:50:31  <garyo-home>   case change? 
17:50:34  <stevenknight> you have to get it stored in the .sconsign file and then run again 
17:50:47  <stevenknight> d'oh!  scratch my case change comment 
17:50:52  <stevenknight> thinking about the next issue 
17:50:55  <garyo-home>   :-) 
17:51:02  <garyo-home>   Anyway, whatever you find there is OK. 
17:51:22  <stevenknight> if you still have the test case handy, send it my way or attach it as a starting point 
17:51:30  <garyo-home>   Either close or post testcase and retriage.  I'll see if I have the testcase. 
17:51:49  <stevenknight> even if it's already fixed, i'd feel better checking in a test to make sure it stays fixed 
17:52:07  <garyo-home>   Good point. 
17:52:22  <stevenknight> 1188:  research, sk, garyo to see if he has his test case 
17:52:23  <stevenknight> done 
17:52:29  <stevenknight> 1193: 
17:52:40  <stevenknight> 1193:  1.3, p2, sk 
17:52:41  <garyo-home>   1193, p3 sk? 
17:52:46  <garyo-home>   yes 
17:52:52  <stevenknight> done 
17:53:04  <garyo-home>   1194 you already closed. 
17:53:05  <stevenknight> 1194:  already fixed 
17:53:28  <stevenknight> 1198:   
17:53:40  <garyo-home>   1198: do you really have to set PYTHONPATH if you install as non-root? 
17:53:50  <stevenknight> not sure about that 
17:53:59  <stevenknight> but maybe i'm misunderstanding the bug 
17:53:59  <garyo-home>   I don't think so, I do that on one of my Linux boxes where I don't have root and I don't think I set PYTHONPATH. 
17:54:14  <stevenknight> i don't set it either 
17:54:29  <stevenknight> but it sounds like the underlying problem is we don't do the right thing with installing the man page 
17:55:03  <garyo-home>   Right, forgot about that part.  Should be a separate issue IMHO, but anyway. 
17:55:20  <stevenknight> ah, okay 
17:55:23  <garyo-home>   He wants us to install the man pages anyway.  That's reasonable. 
17:55:46  <stevenknight> should I just re-title this issue, or open up a separate one? 
17:56:10  <garyo-home>   I'd close this one w/ explanation, and open a new one with a reference to this old one. 
17:56:17  <stevenknight> okay, i'll do that 
17:56:22  <garyo-home>   great. 
17:56:36  <garyo-home>   That's that! 
17:56:41  <stevenknight> 1198:  open new issue, 2.0, p3 ? 
17:56:49  <stevenknight> done 
17:56:51  <stevenknight> excellent 
17:57:06  <stevenknight> we're actually beginning to get this "consensus" thing down...  :-) 
17:57:15  <garyo-home>   Yes, it works well. 
17:58:04  <garyo-home>   There's probably a lot of scheduling discussions we could have right now, but I am pretty burned out and would like to go to bed. 
17:57:59  <stevenknight> looks like you haven't had a chance to tackle 2005q1, shall we just push that off to next time? 
17:58:07  <stevenknight> and go get other things done... :-) 
17:58:13  <garyo-home>   Yes, and let's do 2005q1 next time. 
17:58:14  <stevenknight> okay, sounds good 
17:58:37  <stevenknight> i'm going to try to get sgk_batch integrated into trunk and then kick out a checkpoint so it gets air time 
17:58:43  <stevenknight> and then tackle integrating vs_revamp 
17:58:57  <stevenknight> with another checkpoint for that 
17:58:56  <garyo-home>   +1 on both of those.  I will test them hard! 
17:59:22  <garyo-home>   I'll be able to test on my home Windows box once vs_revamp is out (I have VS2008 here) 
17:59:30  <stevenknight> cool 
18:00:03  <stevenknight> we've been working on a signfiicant refactoring of .vcproj / .sln generation 
18:00:34  <garyo-home>   OK, not my particular cup o' tea but some people like it. 
18:00:37  <stevenknight> still a ways off, so not for 1.3, but I think it'll come with some good stuff for hard-core Windows developers 
18:00:41  <stevenknight> yep 
18:01:25  <garyo-home>   OK Steven, see you later. 
18:01:39  <stevenknight> garyo-home:  good night, thanks again
