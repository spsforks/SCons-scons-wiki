May need to get deferred. 17:55:53 <bdbaddog>     o.k. so I'm behind on that, but looks like I need to shuffle some logic around to make it not too messy for the HOST_* and TARGET_* initialization. 17:56:20 <Jason_at_intel>       does 1.3 get vs vs_revamp 17:56:34 <sgk_> Jason_at_intel:  yes 17:56:34 <bdbaddog>     Seems like that logic should be in the Platform/*.py code. 17:56:35 <garyo-home>   That's the plan right now anyway. 17:56:40 <sgk_> the pacing item is merging vs_revamp to trunk 17:56:53 <Jason_at_intel>       gary: what about the extra vars in MSVS you complained about? 17:57:12 <garyo-home>   btw, I'm using vs_revamp (latest trunk) successfully at work w/ VS2003 and 2005.  Thanks for some well-placed help, Jason. 17:58:05 <Jason_at_intel>       no problem..

The tool part of it isn't anywhere near complete, though.  Should I push it over for your comments? 18:04:27 <Jason_at_intel>       I am interest if nothing else to learn more of the insides of Scons 18:04:53 <sgk_> i do 18:04:57 <sgk_> updating... 18:05:13 <Jason_at_intel>       updated 18:05:14 <bdbaddog>     I can't remember off the top of my head where Platform is initialized. anyone? 18:05:34 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     Platform/<ins>init</ins>.py 18:06:59 <bdbaddog>     Scons.Platform.Platform() is called from somewhere. that's the where I'm looking for. 18:07:25 <bdbaddog>     But if you look at Platform/<ins>init</ins>.py Platform() 18:08:16 <bdbaddog>     you'll see it returns a [PlatformSpec](PlatformSpec), and then assigns the platform module.generated to the <ins>call</ins> 18:08:58 <sgk_> ah 18:09:00 <bdbaddog>     So then is the generated in win32.py the right place to populated the HOST_CPU, and HOST_OS 18:09:09 <bdbaddog>     I mean generate() in win32.py 18:09:47 <bdbaddog>     Also I wanted to move get_architecture() from Tools/MSCommon/arch.py to win32.py 18:10:12 <sgk_> i think the generate() in win32.py 18:10:23 <bdbaddog>     In which case the generate() for each platform should set the HOST_OS/CPU and TARGET_{OS|CPU} as well. 18:10:24 <sgk_> (and in the other platform-speciific modules) 18:10:33 <Jason_at_intel>       HOST_ARCH? or HOST_CPU 18:10:51 <bdbaddog>     I think we decided HOST_CPU to leverage autoconf/auto* nomenclature. 18:11:05 <sgk_> yes, HOST_CPU for exactly that reason 18:11:32 <Jason_at_intel>       I thought it was the other way.. as x86_64 is an architecture not a CPU 18:11:40 <bdbaddog>     So does that sound like a reasonable reorganization of the code? 18:11:47 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     (Actually, I argue it should set PLATFORM_{CPU,VENDOR,KERNEL,OS} since it could be different in different Environment()s.) 18:11:48 <sgk_> why move get_architecture()?  win32.py implies an OS 18:11:58 <sgk_> i was thinking our mapping was arch => cpu 18:11:58 <bdbaddog>     Jason: Hmm it's a cpu family 18:12:06 <bdbaddog>     get_architecture is os specific logic. 18:12:14 <bdbaddog>     at least for win32, it's only for win32. 18:12:38 <Jason_at_intel>       that is fine.. just worried about people wanting a AMD64 CPU or an INTEL64 CPU 18:12:49 <sgk_> oh, right, because of looking for the magic PROCESSOR<ins>ARCHIT* variables 18:12:53 <sgk_> okay, makes sense 18:13:11 <sgk_> [GregNoel](GregNoel):  PLATFORM_* ? 18:13:12 <bdbaddog>     plus the tools aren't initialized yet. 18:13:17 <Jason_at_intel>       Greg: ya.. so I did not push the otehr two as i can't find a build use for them.. only a packing use.. I took what was safe 18:13:23 <sgk_> we were converging on HOST_* and TARGET_* 18:13:24 <Jason_at_intel>       not that it woudl not be added on later 18:13:41 <garyo-home>   I like HOST and TARGET_*. 18:13:42 <bdbaddog>     and that allows us to have (eventually) the platform logic set the default tools lists 18:14:44 <sgk_> we're also converging on _{CPU,VENDOR,KERNEL,OS} suffixes to ride GNU's coattails 18:14:54 <Jason_at_intel>       I thought HOST_ARCH was the "high level" cpu and CPU was the low level 18:15:02 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     In general, whatever (cross-)compiler you want to invoke, it runs on the current platform, so you shouldn't really need the detailed specifics.  Only for what you're generating.  And PLATFORM_* makes sense for that. 18:15:33 <sgk_> sorry, i don't understand that 18:15:43 <Jason_at_intel>       which one? 18:15:48 <sgk_> PLATFORM_ seems ambiguous to me 18:15:49 <garyo-home>   google HOST_ARCH: 3960 results.  google HOST_CPU: 59,700 results. 18:15:55 <sgk_> HOST_* and TARGET_* seem obvious 18:16:07 <bdbaddog>     +1 HOST_ and TARGET_ 18:16:23 <garyo-home>   +1 HOST_ and TARGET_ 18:16:26 <Jason_at_intel>       but these don't map to auto config... i say HOST as Greg might say BUILD 18:16:32 <sgk_> Jason_at_intel:  what would be the distnction between "high level" and "low level" ? 18:16:33 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     I won't argue here; I'll push over the proposal; critique at your leisure. 18:16:40 <sgk_> okay 18:16:48 <sgk_> just reaching exit for shuttle stop 18:16:57 <sgk_> < 1 minute 18:17:14 <bdbaddog>     any reason not to start coding as proposed? 18:17:19 <sgk_> Jason_at_intel:  examples of "high level" vs. "low level" ? 18:17:20 <bdbaddog>     Naming aside ? 18:17:23 <Jason_at_intel>       high level is x86, x86_64... low level is p3, p4, amd64 18:17:28 <sgk_> and what it provides that the GNU model doesn't already cover? 18:17:31 <garyo-home>   jason: I agree 18:17:49 *      [BinkyTheClown](BinkyTheClown) (n=binky@unaffiliated/binkytheclown) has joined #scons 18:17:52 <bdbaddog>     I think realisticaly the low level is left for the user to implement at this point. 18:18:03 <garyo-home>   sgk: compiler flags to generate specific code (SSE2, SSE3).  Prob not that important for us. 18:18:07 <bdbaddog>     it's flags on top of whatever flags are set for bit-ness 18:18:15 <garyo-home>   bdbaddog: that's right, for now at least. 18:18:19 <sgk_> iirc, boost distinguishes between 32-bit and 64-bit "memory model" 18:18:27 <bdbaddog>     yes. not forever, but we have bigger fish to fry 18:18:36 <Jason_at_intel>       I was was just simplifying term to a simple set, as i could not justify to other the need for the other stuff 18:18:36 <sgk_> okay, shuttle 18:18:41 <sgk_> good work, folks 18:18:46 <sgk_> i'll check the log for follow-on discussion 18:18:47 <bdbaddog>     l8r SGK 18:18:50 <garyo-home>   ok, bye for now SGK 18:18:50 *      sgk_ has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer)) 18:19:33 <bdbaddog>     Anyone have feedback + or - for my proposed reorg? 18:19:56 <Jason_at_intel>       I think the move for get_architecture is correct 18:19:58 <bdbaddog>     mainly focused on win32/visual studio/visual c initially. 18:20:34 <bdbaddog>     I figure sunos/irix/hpux/etc would then handle their possible CPU's 18:21:01 <bdbaddog>     in some sense OS===PLATFORM 18:21:26 <garyo-home>   bdbaddog: seems OK to me. 18:21:34 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     platform==unix, os==ultrix 18:21:47 <bdbaddog>     :) ultrix 18:21:51 <bdbaddog>     ahh memories. 18:22:15 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     OK, os==solaris 18:22:08 <Jason_at_intel>       does this mean we will say linux.. instead of posix? 18:22:59 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     no idea.  you asked for an example. 18:23:13 <garyo-home>   jason: yes, I'd say linux/bsd/irix, not just "unix" for all of them. 18:23:27 <garyo-home>   .. or posix. 18:23:38 <Jason_at_intel>       platform=linux os=RH 18:23:53 <bdbaddog>     re posix; I agree, but not sure how much that might break in userland if we make that change. 18:23:54 <Jason_at_intel>       or platform==os==linux 18:23:58 <bdbaddog>     probably need deprecation cycle? 18:24:04 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     Uh, that's vendor==redhat, os==gnu 18:24:17 <bdbaddog>     os=GNU/Linux 18:24:28 <garyo-home>   I would *not* say os=RH/Ubuntu; that's a distro, the OS is still linux. 18:24:41 <bdbaddog>     anyway it's really semantics at some point. 18:24:48 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     vendor==ubuntu 18:24:55 <garyo-home>   Greg has it right there, vendor=ubuntu. 18:24:56 <bdbaddog>     and none of that really impacts vs_revamp issues. 18:24:58 <Jason_at_intel>       vender makes sence 18:25:10 <garyo-home>   but it's not very relevant to Bill's task right now. 18:25:14 <bdbaddog>     and none of that needs to happen in 1.3 18:25:35 <bdbaddog>     we can add HOST_VENDOR/TARGET_VENDOR in 2.x 18:25:45 <Jason_at_intel>       seem like a good idea 18:25:52 <garyo-home>   sure, if it turns out to actually affect something :-) 18:26:01 <bdbaddog>     and that leaves time to figure out which names we'll use. 18:26:12 <garyo-home>   Actually it could, for packaging.  rpm vs. deb for instance. 18:26:26 <Jason_at_intel>       and kernel drivers 18:26:33 <bdbaddog>     true, but that's sort of user space issues. 18:26:45 <garyo-home>   for sure. 18:27:04 <bdbaddog>     if we add too much user space stuff to scons, we'll never improve it. 18:27:11 <Jason_at_intel>       that is why i have not touched in yet in what i have worked on 18:27:40 <bdbaddog>     and/or maybe in a contrib/unsupported/future package. 18:27:48 <bdbaddog>     sorry module. 18:28:19 <garyo-home>   contrib++ 18:28:40 <bdbaddog>     O.k. so I'll start coding all that up (the HOST_OS|CPU, TARGET_OS|CPU) for win32. 18:28:50 <garyo-home>   sounds great to me. 18:28:54 <Jason_at_intel>       so is it _ARCH or _CPU 18:28:59 <bdbaddog>     _CPU 18:29:00 <Jason_at_intel>       i had this from our talk 18:29:06 <Jason_at_intel>       <Jason_at_intel> 18:29:08 <Jason_at_intel>       HOST/TARGET_OS _ARCH or ARCHITECTURE 18:29:10 <Jason_at_intel>       <stevenknight> 18:29:11 <Jason_at_intel>       i thought the consensus was that "platform" should conceptually mean the tuple of relevant things 18:29:13 <Jason_at_intel>       <stevenknight> 18:29:14 <Jason_at_intel>       _OS and _ARCH 18:29:23 <Jason_at_intel>       I missed when this was changed 18:29:43 <bdbaddog>     I think Steven and Greg conversed about this, and sugguested HOST_CPU 18:29:50 <garyo-home>   Bill: I kind of like _ARCH myself for x86/x86_64/mips 18:30:06 <bdbaddog>     I'm agnostic. 18:30:11 <bdbaddog>     about _CPU or _ARCH 18:30:20 <Jason_at_intel>       I was pushing for having CPU and ARCH 18:30:29 <bdbaddog>     well. maybe not.. _ARCH is probably appropriate for this level of specificity 18:30:30 <Jason_at_intel>       ideally add CPU later 18:30:47 <bdbaddog>     Greg U still there? 18:30:58 <garyo-home>   Yes, that's why I like arch.  Leaves room for more specific cpu. 18:31:06 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     sorta; being distracted by pizza 18:31:10 <bdbaddog>     :) 18:31:46 <bdbaddog>     U have an opinion _CPU vs _ARCH when its at the level of x86 and x86_64 vs P4/Core2/Atom/ whatever 18:31:54 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     I favor CPu because we can leverage autoconf stuff; if you deem it must be called arch, then that's not my problem. 18:32:28 <Jason_at_intel>       how do you plan to leverage autoconf? 18:32:40 <Jason_at_intel>       I thought you want to build in a autoconf like system? 18:32:47 <bdbaddog>     we can default CPU = ARCH and then user/platform  can set/user more specific? 18:32:49 <Jason_at_intel>       but not copy everything 18:33:13 <garyo-home>   I think GNU uses ARCH for this, at least sometimes.  See [http://pingus77.free.fr/Gentoo/240/files/xdtv-2.4.0-mmx.patch](http://pingus77.free.fr/Gentoo/240/files/xdtv-2.4.0-mmx.patch) 18:33:17 <garyo-home>   (which I just googled) 18:33:22 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     Just about everybody who configures machines for cross-compiles knows GNU triples; I want people converting from Autoconf to be comfortable. 18:33:30 <Jason_at_intel>       got to love google 18:34:06 <Jason_at_intel>       i guess i never got autoconf to easy work for cross builds 18:34:24 <Jason_at_intel>       it always was to hard to get it to work 18:34:26 <garyo-home>   "OS: linux-gnu, ARCH: i386, CPU: i686" <--- from another google 18:34:27 <[BinkyTheClown](BinkyTheClown)>        [GregNoel](GregNoel): that's me ;) 18:35:01 <bdbaddog>     [GregNoel](GregNoel): I'm not that familiar with autoconf, what's their terms? 18:35:25 <garyo-home>   OK [BinkyTheClown](BinkyTheClown): would you expect ARCH=x86 and CPU=Core2, or just CPU=x86? 18:35:26 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     garyo-home, but what's the GNU triple?  It'll say x86. 18:35:34 <Jason_at_intel>       I agree that we need at least  OS and ARCH for cross builds.. I don't see the need for vender or a CPU 18:36:01 <Jason_at_intel>       I cross build all the time, but maybe I am missing something 18:36:27 <[BinkyTheClown](BinkyTheClown)>        garyo-home: I'd expect CPU=Core2 18:36:47 <Jason_at_intel>       the triple can also say intel64 amd64 and x86_64 18:36:54 <[BinkyTheClown](BinkyTheClown)>        garyo-home: and ARCH=x86 18:37:44 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     No, the triple can only say x86_64.  Anything else is canonicalized.  Try it. 18:37:53 <Jason_at_intel>       so I am for the arch=x86 and cpu=p4r2-see2 18:37:54 <garyo-home>   How do I try it? 18:38:08 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     Look for config-sub. 18:38:36 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     There's probably a copy on your system somewhere; if there's a configure.in, there's a config.sub. 18:40:25 <garyo-home>   my config.sub (Ubuntu 9.04) allows x86, i386, i686, x86_64 at least for cpu 18:40:27 <bdbaddog>     ok. so sounds like HOST_OS, HOST_ARCH (and future HOST_CPU) 18:41:07 <Jason_at_intel>       gary: that is why i like _arch and _CPU 18:41:37 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     try 'config.sub blah-garyo-linux' for blah in x86, i386, i686, x86_64, amd64, ... 18:42:51 <garyo-home>   yup, I did.  It accepts (and returns exactly) those, except for amd64. 18:43:17 <garyo-home>   (which it canonicalizes to x86_64). 18:43:23 <garyo-home>   it's a shell script, btw. 18:43:26 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     Then GNU considers them significantly different, and we should use them.  What more can I say? 18:43:28 <Jason_at_intel>       I think the point we have to remember is why does the user care about these values 18:44:22 <Jason_at_intel>       do 80% of user building care about i386 or i686.. I woudl say no 18:44:33 <Jason_at_intel>       packaging they might care mroe.. but building .. no 18:45:22 <garyo-home>   again, ARCH is high level (x86 vs. x86_64 vs. mips4 vs. powerpc), CPU should be lower level (386 vs 686 vs mmx) 18:45:36 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     garyo-home: don't look in the shell script; it's contaminated with the GNU virus 18:45:54 <garyo-home>   Oh no, I'm infected. 18:46:26 <Jason_at_intel>       GNU virus? 18:46:31 <[GregNoel](GregNoel)>     I've been very careful not to look inside, in case we have to reverse-engineer it. 18:46:34 <garyo-home>   ah-choo! 18:47:05 <bdbaddog>     o.k. I've gotta check out. But I'll code to HOST_OS, HOST_ARCH (with HOST_CPU to be future) 18:47:08 <Jason_at_intel>       so everyone is saying  HOST_OS, HOST_ARCH (and future HOST_CPU) 18:47:24 <Jason_at_intel>       is this agreeable? 18:47:31 <bdbaddog>     I can also float it to the dev list. 18:47:32 <garyo-home>   I think that will be pretty clear to everyone. 18:47:38 <bdbaddog>     +1 18:47:47 <Jason_at_intel>       +1 18:47:50 <garyo-home>   bdbaddog: sure, mention it why not 18:49:07 <bdbaddog>     O.k.
