# Qt4 Tool

## Mainline Repository and Release Tarball

The project page for this tool is on Bitbucket [https://bitbucket.org/dirkbaechle/scons_qt4](https://bitbucket.org/dirkbaechle/scons_qt4).  There you can find more infos about how to get the sources or download a release tarball, but it is recommended to use Mercurial to branch the mainline branch -- a form of continuous release.

## Historical background

David García Garzón had been working on a [Qt4](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.0/) Tool for [SCons](http://www.scons.org) with much success.  He has a few [SCons](http://www.scons.org) tools which you can get from [the SCons section of his webpage](http://www.iua.upf.es/~dgarcia/Codders/sconstools.html). Based on the code mentioned above, Russel Winder set up a Bazaar branch of this tool on Launchpad [https://code.launchpad.net/~russel/sconsaddons/qt4](https://code.launchpad.net/~russel/sconsaddons/qt4) (deprecated, please use the Mercurial/Bitbucket branch instead!). Philippe Vaucher and Dirk Baechle then set about making various additions and fixes to create a production version of the tool. The current mainline can be found from the project page at [https://bitbucket.org/dirkbaechle/scons_qt4](https://bitbucket.org/dirkbaechle/scons_qt4).

## Documentation

If you are interested in compiling Qt4 apps/libs with SCons, you should have a look at its manual: [manual.pdf](manual.pdf) [manual.html](manual.html) and/or the doc archives: [sconsaddons_qt4_manuals_pdf.zip](sconsaddons_qt4_manuals_pdf.zip) [sconsaddons_qt4_manuals_html.zip](sconsaddons_qt4_manuals_html.zip) and then get the latest code of the tool. More detailed instructions for this, can be found on the page of external SCons Tools, the so-called [ToolsIndex](ToolsIndex).
