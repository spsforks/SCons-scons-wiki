You have a big hierarchical tree of projects. If someone accidentally enters:
{{{
scons
}}}
it will build every project in that tree. If you want to ensure that they meant to build everything, add this to the SConstruct file:
{{{
#!python
#prevent accidental building of everything
Default(None)
}}}
If someone does want to build every project, they must do so explicitly by:
{{{
scons .
}}}
