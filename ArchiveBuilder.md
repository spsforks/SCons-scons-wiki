# Archive Builder

The ArchiveBuilder can build a tarfile or a zipfile with an internal directory structure. You can specify a list of directories and/or files to be included as **sources** for your **target**. There is also a 'Files' function that allows to recursively build a list of files matching a list of include patterns and not matching a list of exclude patterns. 

Save this file as 'archive.py' and put it somewhere accessible from your environment.
