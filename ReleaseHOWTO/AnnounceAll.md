Prepare a blurb by starting with a copy of `src/Announce.txt`.  Edit the file and follow these guidelines: 

* If the "scheduled for the next release" section has no content, cut it. 
* Keep the first "changes since release" section (which should be since the last production release). 
* Cut all of the subsequent "changes since release" sections. 
* Leave the copyright notice at the bottom. 
In general, use your own judgment as to what to keep and what to cut. 

**Post Blurb on Fresh``Meat** 

HOW?  If you know how to do this, [UPDATE THIS INFORMATION](ReleaseHOWTO/AnnounceAll). 

**Send Blurb to Other Interested Parties** 

* Debian maintainer? 
* Fedora maintainer? 
* Ubuntu maintainer? 
* Red``Hat maintainer? 
OTHERS?  Are there other individuals we should notify?  Or other mailing lists?  If you know of any, [UPDATE THIS INFORMATION](ReleaseHOWTO/AnnounceAll).
