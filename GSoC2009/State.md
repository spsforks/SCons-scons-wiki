A summary of what's going on.  Try to keep it up-to-date. 


## Lukas

Gary has agreed to mentor.  No backup, possibly Steven can be volunteered. 

JGN: I believe he's communicating with Gary, but the result is not getting back into the wiki, so I can't tell how well his proposal is evolving. 

Gary: proposal update is in the wiki now, and has a lot more detail, as well as responses to my concerns and questions.  He's also posted a fix for a +Easy bug (which I have yet to review). 


## Dave

Mark has agreed to mentor.  Greg will be backup. 

He is in communication with Mark and Greg; still needs to update his proposal.  Greg and Mark are on it. 


## Ariane Paola

Steven has agreed to mentor.  Greg can be backup. 

She wrote Greg twice saying she would update her proposal; no activity yet.  Greg has written her to ask when we can expect the promised update. 

The second message contained a transcript of packaging SCons using Jython.  It got a <ins>long</ins> way before failing, and I'm not convinced that it's Jython that is at fault.  She can also successfully 'import SCons' into a Jython session, which runs 'compat', so that's some progress as well.  She may have tried running the test suite; she says "many tests are failing" but she now knows where to focus her work. 


## Tuba

Ludwig has agreed to mentor.  No backup as yet. 

Received a very stiff note from Greg; has made enormous strides since then (the proposal is at the stage where it should have been after the initial review).
