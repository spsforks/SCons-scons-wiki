# SCons Tool for reStructuredText

Provides a SCons Tool that allows SConstruct scripts to build HTML and LaTeX files from reStructuredText sources. 


## Mainline Repository and Release Tarball

The project page for this tool is on Bitbucket [https://bitbucket.org/dirkbaechle/scons_rest](https://bitbucket.org/dirkbaechle/scons_rest).  There you can find more infos about how to get the sources or download a release tarball, but it is recommended to use Mercurial to branch the mainline branch -- a form of continuous release.   

Detailed instructions about installing and using the Tool can be found in its manual [PDF](RestructuredTextBuilder/manual.pdf) [HTML](RestructuredTextBuilder/manual.html), or on the page of external SCons Tools, the so-called [ToolsIndex](ToolsIndex). 

Note:
