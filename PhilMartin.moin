Hello! My name is Phillip Martin, and I am the main developer of [[http://aztec.sourceforge.net/|Aztec]], a free 3D modelling tool. Living on the east coast of Australia, I tap away at Aztec in my spare time, between work, church, tennis and sculpting.

Aztec recently moved to SCons for its build system, since it is the only tool that we could find that built properly using [[http://www.mingw.org|MingW]] and [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/|MSVC]] on Windows, and also built on linux and MacOSX.

Congratulations to the SCons team, and a very large thankyou from me for creating such a great and useful tool.
