## Checklist for Google Summer of Code 2008

* <del>Revamp the [proposal description](GSoC2008/Proposal) to emphasize process and be less intimidating.</del>  [2007-Apr-22: _a draft is available for comment_ - JGN] [2008-Mar-04: _final draft published_ - JGN] 
* <del>Get [[!bug 1234]] and [[!bug 4321]] links working.</del>  [2007-05-30: _Fixed by Gary Oberbrunner; see [bug #1650](/SCons/scons/issues/1650)_ - JGN] 
* **Identify more mentors** 
   * Recruitment should be on-going throughout the year. 
   * There should be a specific campaign in January or February. 
* Harass Greg to write a [mentors' how-to](SummerOfCodeMentoring) for SCons.  [2007-04-20: _Started work_ - JGN] 
* **Get ideas written up sooner** and figure out how to write better task suggestions. 
* Mine for ideas wherever we can: 
   * Monitor mailing lists and capture suitable ideas. 
   * Ideas from last year. 
   * Requests for enhancements and new features in the issues database. 
   * Defects (bugs) in the issues database. 
   * Advertisements on scons-dev and especially on scons-users mailing lists. 
   * Advertisements on scons.org and scons.tigris.org web pages. 
   * [Projects/companies that use SCons](SconsProjects). 
   * **Where else?**  Update this checklist if other sources are found so that we won't forget them in future. 
* Be prepared for Google's announcement: 
   * Have the web pages done _before_ the application period so Google can audit them. 
   * Get our application in to Google immediately, so they have plenty of time to look us over and confirm that we are a viable candidate. 
* Advertise our participation to drum up more submissions.  We will be listed on Google's own heavily-advertised web pages, but there are plenty of other places: 
   * Mailing lists (scons-users primarily, but also scons-dev). 
   * Google-summer-of-code-discuss mailing list. 
   * www.scons.org and scons.tigris.org web pages. 
   * Related third-party sources: 
      * tigris.org 
      * python.org (they mention Python-powered projects in their own SoC pages) 
      * sourceforge.net (although that's a tenuous connection) 
      * [Projects/companies that use SCons](SconsProjects), both web pages and mailing lists. 
   * **Where else?**  Update this checklist if other sources are found so that we won't forget them in future.
