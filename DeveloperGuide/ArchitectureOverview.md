# SCons Architecture Overview

Glib one-sentence version: SCons reads all the SConstructs and SConscripts, builds a dependency graph, and then executes that graph by building whatever targets are out of date.

For more details, see, for now, the [SconsProcessOverview](../SconsProcessOverview) page.
