The main SCons mercurial repository is kept at bitbucket, its URL is https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons. All the current development work is typically done on the "`default`" branch.
To clone the repo to your local machine, the command line should look something like this:
 {{{hg clone https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons}}}

If your goal is to actually contribute, you should fork the repo instead. Check out SconsMercurialWorkflows for a more detailed description of how to create pull requests for your code and documentation patches.
