# Easy Issues To Fix

In our bug tracker at [Tigris](http://scons.tigris.org) we mark some bugs as "Easy"; these are good ones to start with if you're interested in contributing to SCons.  If you submit a patch for any of them, especially if you follow the model in the [DeveloperGuide](DeveloperGuide) so it contains the proper test case and documentation, the SCons user community will be very grateful to you!
