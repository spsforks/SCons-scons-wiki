= Easy Issues To Fix =
In our bug tracker at [[http://scons.tigris.org|Tigris]] we mark some bugs as "Easy"; these are good ones to start with if you're interested in contributing to SCons.  If you submit a patch for any of them, especially if you follow the model in the DeveloperGuide so it contains the proper test case and documentation, the SCons user community will be very grateful to you!

Here is the <<BugSchedule(@KEYWORD=Easy, prioritized list of simpler issues)>> you can work on.  If someone's name is on the issue, don't hesitate to contact them to see if they would be willing to let you work on it. That person would also be a good source of information and advice while working on the bug.  If there's no name on the issue, drop a note to the dev list to avoid duplicating effort.
