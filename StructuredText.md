Structured text is text that uses indentation and simple symbology to indicate the structure of a document. For the next generation of structured text, see [!MoinMoin ReStructuredText desc="ReStructuredText] and [here](http://dev.zope.org/Members/jim/StructuredTextWiki/StructuredTextNG). 

A structured string consists of a sequence of paragraphs separated by one or more blank lines.  Each paragraph has a level which is defined as the minimum indentation of the paragraph.  A paragraph is a sub-paragraph of another paragraph if the other paragraph is the last preceding paragraph that has a lower level. 

Special symbology is used to indicate special constructs: 

* A single-line paragraph whose immediately succeeding paragraphs are lower level is treated as a header. 
* A paragraph that begins with a '-', '*', or 'o' is treated as an unordered list (bullet) element. 
* A paragraph that begins with a sequence of digits followed by a white-space character is treated as an ordered list element. 
* A paragraph that begins with a sequence of sequences, where each sequence is a sequence of digits or a sequence of letters followed by a period, is treated as an ordered list element. 
* A paragraph with a first line that contains some text, followed by some white-space and '--' is treated as a descriptive list element. The leading text is treated as the element title. 
* Sub-paragraphs of a paragraph that ends in the word 'example' or the word 'examples', or '::' is treated as example code and is output as is. 
* Text enclosed single quotes (with white-space to the left of the first quote and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second quote) is treated as example code. 
* Text surrounded by '*' characters (with white-space to the left of the first '*' and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second '*') is emphasized. 
* Text surrounded by '**' characters (with white-space to the left of the first '**' and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second '**') is made strong. 
* Text surrounded by '_' underscore characters (with whitespace to the left and whitespace or punctuation to the right) is made underlined. 
* Text encloded by double quotes followed by a colon, a URL, and concluded by punctuation plus white space, *or* just white space, is treated as a hyper link. For example: 
         * "Zope":[http://www.zope.org/](http://www.zope.org/) is ... 
Is interpreted as '&lt;a href="[http://www.zope.org/"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt;](http://www.zope.org/"&gt;Zope&lt;/a&gt;) is ....' 

**Note:** This works for relative as well as absolute URLs. 

* Text enclosed by double quotes followed by a comma, one or more spaces, an absolute URL and concluded by punctuation plus white space, or just white space, is treated as a hyper link. For example: 
         * "mail me", [mailto:amos@digicool.com](mailto:amos@digicool.com). 
Is interpreted as '&lt;a href="[mailto:amos@digicool.com"&gt;mail](mailto:amos@digicool.com"&gt;mail) me&lt;/a&gt;.' 

* Text enclosed in brackets which consists only of letters, digits, underscores and dashes is treated as hyper links within the document. For example: 
         * As demonstrated by Smith [12] this technique is quite effective. 
Is interpreted as '... by Smith &lt;a href="#12"&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; this ...'. Together with the next rule this allows easy coding of references or end notes. 

* Text enclosed in brackets which is preceded by the start of a line, two periods and a space is treated as a named link. For example: 
         * . [12] "Effective Techniques" Smith, Joe ... 
Is interpreted as '&lt;a name="12"&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; "Effective Techniques" ...'. Together with the previous rule this allows easy coding of references or end notes. 

* A paragraph that has blocks of text enclosed in '||' is treated as a table. The text blocks correspond to table cells and table rows are denoted by newlines. By default the cells are center aligned. A cell can span more than one column by preceding a block of text with an equivalent number of cell separators '||'. Newlines and '|' cannot be a part of the cell text. For example: 
   * ```txt
|||| **Ingredients** ||
|| *Name* || *Amount* ||
||Spam||10||
||Eggs||3||
```renders like this: 
   * [[!table header="no" class="mointable" data="""
 **Ingredients** ||
 *Name*  |  *Amount* 
Spam | 10
Eggs | 3
"""]]
