Ah! We don't really have a defined, public interface for this. We should have. In the meantime, you can use:

{{{
import SCons
print SCons.__version__
}}}

(Where, of course, you can do whatever you like with the {{{SCons.__version__}}} string, not just print it.)

If you are looking to ensure a certain version of SCons, use:

{{{EnsureSConsVersion()}}}

You use it thusly:
{{{EnsureSConsVersion(0, 96, 93)}}}
