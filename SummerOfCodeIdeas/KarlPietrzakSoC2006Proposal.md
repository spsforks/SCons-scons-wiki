# Karl Pietrzak's Google Summer of Code 2006 Proposal

[[!toc ]] 
## Introduction


### About the Author

My name is Karl Pietrzak, and I am currently a senior at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu) in Rochester, NY, where I will graduate with a BS in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.rit.edu) in November 2006.  I was born in [Krak√≥w, Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakow) and I came to the United States at the tender age of five.  As such, I can speak, read, and write [Polish](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Polish_language_course), as well an a tinge of Spanish. 

I am writing this document in order to receive at a [SCons](http://www.scons.org) [Google Summer of Code 2006](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) project.  My interest in [SCons](http://www.scons.org) started with my massive frustrations with the autotools (i.e., autoconf, automake, etc.); I feel the world could use something better, and [SCons](http://www.scons.org)--with the power of Python behind--is that alternative. 

Throughout the past few years of my[SCons](http://www.scons.org) usage for both commercial and personal use, I have contributed a few small patches where I saw a bug or a need for a minor improvement.  Now, however, I would love the opportunity to become a [SCons](http://www.scons.org) developer so that my involvement becomes more substantial and permanent.  I am very excited to get the opportunity to work on this proposal for this summer!
