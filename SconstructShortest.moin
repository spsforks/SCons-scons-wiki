''Moved this from SconstructShortMsvcWin32''
-----
Just a quick comment:  the above isn't ''really'' the shortest SConstruct possible.  That would be something like this:
{{{
#create a.exe from a.c (assuming win32)
Program('a.c') 
}}}
which would build `a.exe` from `a.c` using all the defaults.  Notice that as of SCons 0.95 or so, you can use the default environment so you don't even need to create one separately.
