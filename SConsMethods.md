# SCons Methods

[[!map pages="SConsMethods/*"]] Each child page of this page is a SCons method or function (methods are attached to an object, in our case, it's usually attached to an Environment, while functions are stand-alone; many Environment methods are also available as stand-alone functions, so sometimes it can be confusing).  For the most part, they reproduce the man page, but in the long run, it is hoped that they will attract additional examples and descriptions so that they will be more like the User's Guide.
