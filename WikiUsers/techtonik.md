#### Why tigris.org is bad?

1. Anonymous code access in SVN [requires 'guest' username](http://scons.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=1268&dsMessageId=2445781). This confuses users, who usually don't know about 'guest'. For comparison, Google Code offers [SVN as a host for web pages](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/SubversionFAQ#How_can_I_make_SVN_serve_HTML_and_images_with_the_correct_Conten). 
1. [Source code browser](http://scons.tigris.org/source/browse/scons/) doesn't show directory history. 
1. There is a forum interface to mailing list, but unlike Google Groups you can't monitor individual threads. 
1. I can't sign in with my OpenID
