Currently writing [http://www.wlug.org.nz/MakeToSCons](http://www.wlug.org.nz/MakeToSCons). 

I might be found as sammydre in the IRC channel. Sometimes. 

I'll probably look to add more to the wiki as I continue learning SCons. At the moment I am in the process of changing all my build systems to SCons. 

More about me can be found: [http://www.wlug.org.nz/SamJansen](http://www.wlug.org.nz/SamJansen) or [http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2](http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2).
