Trying to contribute some useful information and keep things up to date on the wiki. Have several projects built using SCons:  

[GtkRadiant](http://www.qeradiant.com): level editor for id technology games 

Several id games are compiled for GNU/Linux and MacOS X using scons. The publicly available SDKs for those games also use scons. These games include Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Doom 3, Quake 4 and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars
