I'm a consultant working with software tools such as version control (CVS, Subversion), build systems (make, SCons) and bug trackers (bugzilla, Jira). Most of my clients are smaller startups in Silicon Valley. I'm also the author of O'Reilly's [Practical Development Environments](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/practicalde). My contact details and more information are on my [web page.](http://www.pobox.com/~doar)
