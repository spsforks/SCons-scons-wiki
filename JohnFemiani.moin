I am a Ph.D Student at Arizona State Universisty. My interests are Computer Graphics, Pattern Recognition, and Computer Vision.
Since I discovered SCons I have been using it in my research projects, and compiling my code in both msvc and mingw on a win32 system.

Currently I am learning a lot about SCons, and as I learn I plan to update documentation on this wiki.
