# Checklist for Google Summer of Code 2007

* <del>Gather the information about what should be contained in a proposal.  It's currently scattered and needs to be collected in one place.</del>  [2007-Feb-18: Done, at least a [solid draft](GSoC2007/Proposal) - JGN] 
* <del>Identify mentors right away</del> [2007-Mar-8 sample done] 
* <del>Possibly create a mentors@scons mailing list if we have enough.</del> [2007-Feb-22 done] 
* <del>**Get ideas written up sooner**</del> and figure out how to write better task suggestions. 
* Mine for ideas wherever we can: 
   * <del>Ideas from last year.</del> 
   * <del>Requests for enhancements and new features in the issues database.</del> 
   * <del>Defects (bugs) in the issues database.</del> 
   * <del>Advertisements on scons-dev and especially on scons-users mailing lists.</del> 
   * Advertisements on scons.org and scons.tigris.org web pages. 
   * [Projects/companies that use SCons](SconsProjects). 
   * **Where else?**  Update [SummerOfCode](SummerOfCode) if other sources are found so that we won't forget them in future. 
* Be prepared for Google's announcement: 
   * Have the web pages done _before_ the application period so Google can audit them. 
   * <del>Get our application in to Google immediately, so they have plenty of time to look us over and confirm that we are a viable candidate.</del> 
   * <del>Use a name that better says what we do</del> [2007-Mar-8 done] 
* Advertise our participation to drum up more submissions.  We will be listed on Google's own heavily-advertised web pages, but there are plenty of other places: 
   * <del>Mailing lists (scons-users primarily, but also scons-dev).</del> 
   * <del>www.scons.org and scons.tigris.org web pages.</del> 
   * Related third-party sources: 
      * tigris.org 
      * python.org (they mention Python-powered projects in their own SoC pages) 
      * sourceforge.net (although that's a tenuous connection) 
      * [Projects/companies that use SCons](SconsProjects), both web pages and mailing lists. 
   * **Where else?**  Update [SummerOfCode](SummerOfCode) if other sources are found so that we won't forget them in future.
