### Tweak the Spreadsheet

* Click on the column header for the last (empty) column (usually column H). 
* From the "Delete" menu, select "Delete column". 
* Click and sweep out all the remaining column headers (usually A to G). 
* From the "Format" menu, choose "Plain text". 
* From the "Align" menu, choose "top". 
* Click on the column header for the "Pri" column (usually column E). 
* From the "Align" menu, choose "center" (not "middle"). 
* Click and sweep out the first two column headers. 
* From the "Align" menu, choose "right". 
* Select the row header for the first row. 
* Select "Bold" from the menu bar. 
* Grab the header marker (just above the "1" for the first row; do <ins>**NOT**</ins> grab the bar anywhere else or you will be uploading this spreadsheet again) and move it between the "1" and "2". 
* Click on any cell (_i.e._, anywhere so that neither a complete row or column is selected) 
* The lines between the column headers are selectable; with care you can grab them and change the width of the columns.  ID, Votes, and Pri should be as tight as you dare make them; leave a reasonable space for the others and make the last column as wide as you have space.
