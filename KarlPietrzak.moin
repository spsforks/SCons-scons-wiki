== Autobiography ==
I'm currently a student at the [[http://www.rit.edu|Rochester Institute of Technology]], where I will graduate with a BS in [[http://www.cs.rit.edu|Computer Science]] in November 2006. I have worked for [[http://www.ibm.com|IBM]], [[http://www.amd.com|Advanced Micro Devices]], and [[http://www.thomson.com|Thomson Legal and Regulatory]] throughout my (so far) short career.  Resume to come soon, perhaps.

== Goals ==
I have been a SCons outsider for a long time by simply following the mailing lists.  Now, however, I want to become more involved and I hope I have some skills that could be of use to the SCons team!
