---

# Source Files

# Building and Linking

* [using Origin](UsingOrigin) - using $ORIGIN to specify runtime search path for libraries
* [using pkg-config](UsingPkgConfig) - many libraries these days come with .pc files, such as GTK+, but how do you use them?

* [build-time callback](BuildTimeCallback) - add a function called at build time
* [RightNow](RightNow) - build one or more targets during the SConscript reading phase, then continue reading SConscripts
